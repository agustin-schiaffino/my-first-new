            <p>Schools will start offering jabs to 12 to 15-year-old pupils this week after the UK's top medics gave the plan the green light.
            </p>
            <p>Some 3 million youngsters are now eligible for the Covid vaccine as part of wider Government efforts to battle the virus this winter.
            </p>
            <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decided against recommending mass vaccination of this age group on medical grounds alone - but handed the decision to the UK's chief medical officers.
            </p>
            <p>England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and his counterparts decided to press ahead with the move on "public health grounds" as they argued it was "likely vaccination will help reduce transmission of Covid-19 in schools".
            </p>
            <p>Children have suffered significant disruption to their education during the pandemic and the Government is keen to ensure schools don't have to close again.
