                Schools will start offering jabs to 12 to 15-year-old pupils this week after the UK's top medics gave
                the plan the green light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some 3 million youngsters are now eligible for the Covid vaccine as part of wider Government efforts
                to battle the virus this winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decided against recommending mass vaccination
                of this age group on medical grounds alone - but handed the decision to the UK's chief medical officers.
            </p>
            <p>
                England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and his counterparts decided to press ahead with
                the move on "public health grounds" as they argued it was "likely vaccination will help reduce
                transmission of Covid-19 in schools".
            </p>
            <p>
                Children have suffered significant disruption to their education during the pandemic and the Government
                is keen to ensure schools don't have to close again.

                Health Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp" target="_blank">Sajid Javid</a> immediately
                backed the plan, paving the way for 12 to 15-year-olds to begin being offered vaccines this week.

            <p>
                Here's how the rollout will work.
