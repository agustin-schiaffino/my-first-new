                    Young people aged 12 to 15-years-old will be offered the Covid vaccine in the UK from this week in a
                    schools based vaccination programme

                Schools will start offering jabs to 12 to 15-year-old pupils this week after the UK's top medics gave
                the plan the green light.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some 3 million youngsters are now eligible for the Covid vaccine as part of wider Government efforts
                to battle the virus this winter.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decided against recommending mass vaccination
                of this age group on medical grounds alone - but handed the decision to the UK's chief medical officers.
                </p>
                <p>
                England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and his counterparts decided to press ahead with
                the move on "public health grounds" as they argued it was "likely vaccination will help reduce
                transmission of Covid-19 in schools".
                </p>
                <p>
                Children have suffered significant disruption to their education during the pandemic and the Government
                is keen to ensure schools don't have to close again.

                Health Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp" target="_blank">Sajid Javid</a> immediately
                backed the plan, paving the way for 12 to 15-year-olds to begin being offered vaccines this week.
                </p>
                <p>
                Here's how the rollout will work.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Which children will get the jab?</h2>
                <p>
                    All children aged 12 to 15-years-old will be offered a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chief medical officers think one dose will significantly cut the risk of teens
                    getting Covid and passing the virus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clinical evidence shows that a single dose of Pfizer reduces the risk of catching the
                    Delta variant by 55% and has a much higher effect on preventing severe illness and death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The medics decided against recommending two doses after considering data from the US
                    and Canada, which indicated a higher rate of an extremely rare inflammation of the 
                    heart muscle, known as myocarditis, after a second dose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some youngsters may have already been vaccinated because they have underlying health 
                    conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Who will be administering the jabs?</h2>
                <p>
                    The rollout will be run by the School Age Immunisation Service (SAIS), which already 
                    delivers vaccinations in schools for things like flu and HPV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Schools will work with their local SAIS provider to arrange vaccination sessions 
                    and to set up facilities on site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heads will be responsible for ensuring parents and children get information 
                    leaflets, consent forms and invitation letters from SAIS about the Covid vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They will also be asked to compile lists of which pupils are eligible for the jab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vaccines will be done by healthcare staff, "which may include nurses, healthcare
                    support workers, administrative staff, and other associated professionals who specialise
                    in the delivery of school age vaccinations", according to the Government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will be done in schools wherever possible but the official guidance says
                    "there might be certain areas or certain schools where this is not possible".
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Will is be mandatory?</h2>
                <p>
                    No. The Government has not made getting vaccinated a legal requirement for anyone, regardless of age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Former Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is now the Education Secretary, said "no one should be
                    stigmatised" by the vaccination programme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However it is strongly encouraged as the vaccine has been proven to give vital protections against the virus.
