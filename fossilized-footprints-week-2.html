						<span>(CNN)</span> North and South America were the last continents to be settled by humans, but
						exactly when that started is a topic that has divided archaeologists.
					</p>
					<p>
						The commonly held view is that people arrived in North America from Asia via Beringia, a land bridge
						that once connected the two continents, at the end of the Ice Age around 13,000 to 16,000 years ago.
						But more <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/22/world/north-america-early-humans-arrival-scn-trnd/
						index.html">recent -- and some contested -- discoveries</a> have suggested humans might have been in North
						America earlier.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, researchers studying fossilized human footprints in New Mexico say they have the first
						unequivocal evidence that humans were in North America at least 23,000 years ago.
					</p>

						"The peopling of the Americas is one of those things that has been for many years very contentious
						and a lot of archeologists hold views with almost religious zeal," said Matthew Bennett, a professor
						and specialist in ancient footprints at Bournemouth University and author of a study on the new
						findings that published in the journal Science on Thursday.
					</p>
					<p>
						"One of the problems is that there is very few data points," he added.
					</p>
				</section>

					<h2>'Unequivocal'</h2>
					<p>
						Bennett and his colleagues were able to accurately date 61 footprints by radiocarbon dating layers
						of aquatic plant seeds that had been preserved above and below them. The prints, which were
						discovered in the Tularosa Basin in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm" target="_blank">White Sands
						National Park</a>, were made 21,000 to 23,000 years ago, the
						researchers found.
					</p>
					<p>
						The timing and location of the prints in southwestern North America suggests that humans must have
						been on the continent much earlier than previously thought, Bennett said. The people who made the
						footprints -- mostly teenagers and children -- were living in New Mexico at the height of the last
						Ice Age.
					</p>
					<p>
						Between 19,000 and 26,000 years ago, a period known as the Last Glacial Maximum, two massive ice
						sheets covered the northern third of the continent and reached as far south as New York City,
						Cincinnati and Des Moines, Iowa. The ice and cold temperatures would have made a journey between
						Asia and Alaska impossible during that time, meaning the people who made the footprints likely
						arrived much earlier.
					</p>
					<p>
						"It's the first unequivocal site and a good data point that places people in the American southwest
						around the last glacial maximum," Bennett said.
					</p>
					<figure>

					<p>
						"That's the important point because it allows you to look at the older sites, the more controversial
						sites, with a different light."
					</p>
					<p>
						One such site is <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/22/world/
						north-america-early-humans-arrival-scn-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Chiquihuite Cave in Zacatecas</a>
						in central Mexico, where flaked stone tools shaped by humans that date back to 30,000 years ago have been
						found.
					</p>
					<p>
						David Rachal, a geoarchaeology consultant who has worked with the human and animal trackways in the
						Tularosa Basin for eight years, said the footprint dates provided by Bennett and his team looked
						"extremely solid," with seeds providing very reliable and precise ages through radiocarbon dating.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Plus, these dates come from seed layers located above and below the trackway surface, which
						brackets the track-forming event. You could not ask for a better setup," said Rachal, who was not
						involved in the study.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, he said it was puzzling that no artifacts, such as stone tools, had been found in the area.
					</p>
					<p>
						"These tracks suggest that people were in New Mexico way earlier than expected. This is a theme that
						is gaining some serious traction in the literature. However, we need to be cautious and more
						research needs to be done before we start doing a lot of arm waving," Rachal said.

					<h2>Kids and teens</h2>
					<p>
						The footprints were likely made in soft ground at the edge of a wetland. Wind probably blew dust
						over the surface, silting in the prints, Bennett said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hunter-gatherers, he said, would have done a lot more than 10,000 steps a day, meaning at least a
						few footprints would survive in the fossil record.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Week-2/Imgs/photo-4.jpg" alt="footprints">

					</figure>
					<p>
						The analysis of the dimensions of the footprints suggested they were made by children between 9 and
						14 years old -- a pattern that's seen at other fossilized footprint sites. Tracks of mammoths, giant
						ground sloth, dire wolves and birds are all present at the site as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						"One hypothesis for this is that division of labor, in which adults are involved in skilled tasks
						whereas fetching and carrying are delegated to teenagers," the study noted.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Children accompany the teenagers, and collectively they leave a higher number of footprints that
						preferentially recorded in the fossil record."
